## ABOUT

Django project which allows user to create any plan that involves group of people and cost splitting. <br />
If you are planning holidays, trips or travels with bunch of friends that's a tool for you. No more tens of posts on facebook groups with unreadable informations about costs splitting *(how much? when I should pay? why so much? did'n we pay it already?)*.<br />
It got you covered !
<br />
